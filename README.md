Agamiksmasin 2.0 - FLL 2024-2025 SUBMERGED

This repository contains the Python code for controlling the Agamiksmasin 2.0, a LEGO SPIKE Prime robot built for the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) 2024-2025 SUBMERGED season by team "Aga Miks?". The code features advanced control algorithms, including Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers, for precise movement and mission execution.

Features:

    PID-Controlled Drive Function: Ensures accurate straight-line movement with angle correction.

    PID-Controlled Turn Function: Provides precise turning with minimal overshoot.

    Color-Based Autonomous Mission Selection: The robot selects missions based on detected colors, allowing for flexible and adaptive gameplay.

    Inertia Compensation: Adjusts for the robot's momentum to improve accuracy, especially during short movements.

    Modular Code Structure: Easy-to-understand and maintainable code with separate functions for driving, turning, and mission execution.
